  clientDescription: `Hi, I’m Robert. I’ve been a licensed massage therapist for 16 years, 
  and before that, I spent 4 years working as a physical therapist assistant. I travel to my clients’ 
  homes because I believe you deserve to be treated in a comfortable, familiar environment without having to 
  worry about high prices. My work ranges from deep tissue massage to gentle healing touch techniques, so I can customize your treatment to 
  exactly what you need. I started this business model to make quality care more accessible and convenient for everyone.`,
